# db-16 M&A Workflow Queries - Goal-Oriented Summary

## Overview

The database contains 30 SQL queries designed to support M&A due diligence workflows for flood risk assessment. These queries enable M&A teams to determine property acquisition viability by assessing current and future flood risk across multiple data sources (FEMA, NOAA, USGS, NASA), evaluate overall deal risk through portfolio-wide analysis and geographic risk concentration identification, assess historical flooding patterns to inform pricing and risk allocation, project long-term coastal property viability considering sea level rise scenarios, identify riverine flood risks for properties near waterways, validate prediction model reliability, identify properties within flood zones for insurance and regulatory compliance, track risk trends over time to inform acquisition timing, identify geographic clusters of high-risk properties for portfolio concentration analysis, score property vulnerability for due diligence prioritization, calculate financial impact for price negotiation and deal structuring, classify FEMA flood zone risk levels for insurance cost determination, compare sea level rise scenarios for best-case and worst-case coastal deal outcomes, analyze historical streamflow patterns for future flooding frequency prediction, verify NASA model accuracy for reliable deal decisions, generate portfolio risk summaries for stakeholder presentation, ensure data quality for confident decision-making, optimize spatial analysis performance for rapid large portfolio assessment, combine multiple risk scores into unified ratings for simplified decision-making, project risk across multiple time horizons to assess property value over acquisition hold periods, determine elevation-based flood protection for mitigation needs assessment, evaluate historical flood damage for future loss estimation, compare model accuracy for selecting reliable predictions, analyze geographic risk distribution for portfolio diversification assessment, assess risk by property type to identify vulnerable asset classes, analyze cascading flood risk effects for compound risk scenario understanding, identify deal-breaker properties exceeding risk thresholds for target filtering, evaluate cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures for acquired properties, assess portfolio diversification to determine risk concentration versus spread, and generate comprehensive due diligence reports to support final go/no-go acquisition decisions.

## Detailed Query List

**Query 1:** Determine if a property is worth acquiring by assessing current and future flood risk across all data sources

**Query 2:** Evaluate overall deal risk by analyzing portfolio-wide flood exposure and identifying geographic risk concentrations

**Query 3:** Assess if acquisition targets have a history of flooding to inform deal pricing and risk allocation

**Query 4:** Project long-term viability of coastal properties to determine if sea level rise makes acquisition unviable

**Query 5:** Identify riverine flood risk for properties near waterways to assess flood frequency and severity

**Query 6:** Validate reliability of flood predictions to ensure risk assessments are based on accurate models

**Query 7:** Identify which properties are inside flood zones to determine mandatory insurance requirements and risk exposure

**Query 8:** Track whether flood risk is increasing or decreasing over time to inform acquisition timing decisions

**Query 9:** Identify geographic clusters of high-risk properties to assess portfolio concentration risk

**Query 10:** Score property vulnerability to prioritize which properties need deeper due diligence

**Query 11:** Calculate financial impact of flood risk to negotiate acquisition price discounts and deal terms

**Query 12:** Classify FEMA flood zone risk levels to determine insurance costs and regulatory requirements

**Query 13:** Compare different sea level rise scenarios to assess best-case and worst-case outcomes for coastal deals

**Query 14:** Analyze historical streamflow patterns to predict future riverine flooding frequency

**Query 15:** Verify NASA model accuracy to ensure flood predictions are reliable for deal decisions

**Query 16:** Generate portfolio risk summaries to present to M&A committees and stakeholders

**Query 17:** Ensure data quality is sufficient to make confident acquisition decisions

**Query 18:** Optimize spatial analysis performance to enable rapid risk assessment of large property portfolios

**Query 19:** Combine multiple risk scores into unified risk rating to simplify decision-making

**Query 20:** Project risk over multiple time horizons to assess property value over acquisition hold period

**Query 21:** Determine if property elevation provides protection from flooding to assess mitigation needs

**Query 22:** Evaluate historical flood damage to estimate potential future losses

**Query 23:** Compare model accuracy to select most reliable flood predictions for deal analysis

**Query 24:** Analyze geographic risk distribution to assess portfolio diversification and concentration

**Query 25:** Assess risk by property type to identify which asset classes are most vulnerable

**Query 26:** Analyze cascading flood risk effects to understand compound risk scenarios

**Query 27:** Identify deal-breaker properties that exceed risk thresholds to filter acquisition targets

**Query 28:** Evaluate cost-effectiveness of flood mitigation measures for acquired properties

**Query 29:** Assess portfolio diversification to determine if risk is concentrated or spread across regions

**Query 30:** Generate comprehensive due diligence report to support final go/no-go acquisition decision
