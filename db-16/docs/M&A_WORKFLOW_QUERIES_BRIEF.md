# db-16 M&A Workflow Queries - Goal-Oriented Brief Summary

## Pre-Acquisition Due Diligence Goals

**Query 1:** Determine if a property is worth acquiring by assessing current and future flood risk across all data sources

**Query 2:** Evaluate overall deal risk by analyzing portfolio-wide flood exposure and identifying geographic risk concentrations

**Query 3:** Assess if acquisition targets have a history of flooding to inform deal pricing and risk allocation

**Query 4:** Project long-term viability of coastal properties to determine if sea level rise makes acquisition unviable

**Query 5:** Identify riverine flood risk for properties near waterways to assess flood frequency and severity

**Query 6:** Validate reliability of flood predictions to ensure risk assessments are based on accurate models

**Query 7:** Identify which properties are inside flood zones to determine mandatory insurance requirements and risk exposure

**Query 8:** Track whether flood risk is increasing or decreasing over time to inform acquisition timing decisions

**Query 9:** Identify geographic clusters of high-risk properties to assess portfolio concentration risk

**Query 10:** Score property vulnerability to prioritize which properties need deeper due diligence

**Query 11:** Calculate financial impact of flood risk to negotiate acquisition price discounts and deal terms

**Query 12:** Classify FEMA flood zone risk levels to determine insurance costs and regulatory requirements

**Query 13:** Compare different sea level rise scenarios to assess best-case and worst-case outcomes for coastal deals

**Query 14:** Analyze historical streamflow patterns to predict future riverine flooding frequency

**Query 15:** Verify NASA model accuracy to ensure flood predictions are reliable for deal decisions

**Query 16:** Generate portfolio risk summaries to present to M&A committees and stakeholders

**Query 17:** Ensure data quality is sufficient to make confident acquisition decisions

**Query 18:** Optimize spatial analysis performance to enable rapid risk assessment of large property portfolios

**Query 19:** Combine multiple risk scores into unified risk rating to simplify decision-making

**Query 20:** Project risk over multiple time horizons to assess property value over acquisition hold period

**Query 21:** Determine if property elevation provides protection from flooding to assess mitigation needs

**Query 22:** Evaluate historical flood damage to estimate potential future losses

**Query 23:** Compare model accuracy to select most reliable flood predictions for deal analysis

**Query 24:** Analyze geographic risk distribution to assess portfolio diversification and concentration

**Query 25:** Assess risk by property type to identify which asset classes are most vulnerable

**Query 26:** Analyze cascading flood risk effects to understand compound risk scenarios

**Query 27:** Identify deal-breaker properties that exceed risk thresholds to filter acquisition targets

**Query 28:** Evaluate cost-effectiveness of flood mitigation measures for acquired properties

**Query 29:** Assess portfolio diversification to determine if risk is concentrated or spread across regions

**Query 30:** Generate comprehensive due diligence report to support final go/no-go acquisition decision
