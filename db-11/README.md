# Parking Intelligence Database - db-11

**Deliverable:** db-11
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress
**Created:** 2026-02-04

## Overview

This database contains parking intelligence data for marketing analysis, mirroring SpotHero's business model. The database aggregates parking facility data, demographics, traffic patterns, airport statistics, venue information, and market intelligence metrics from government sources to support parking marketplace operations across 400+ cities in North America.

**Target Data Size:** 1 GB of comprehensive parking intelligence data

## Data Sources

### Government Sources

1. **Data.gov CKAN API** - Parking facility datasets from various cities
2. **Census Bureau API** - Demographics and population data for metropolitan areas
3. **BTS TranStats** - Airport passenger volumes and statistics
4. **FAA Airport Data** - Passenger boarding and cargo statistics
5. **FHWA Traffic Data** - Traffic volume trends and highway statistics
6. **City Open Data Portals** - Real-time parking utilization and pricing data

### Geographic Coverage

- **400+ cities** across USA and Canada
- **Major metropolitan areas** (MSAs)
- **Top 50 airports** by passenger volume
- **Major sports stadiums** and venues
- **Business districts** and downtown areas

## Usage

### Marketing Intelligence Queries

See `queries/queries.md` for SQL queries covering:
- Parking facility analysis and optimization
- Market demand and supply analysis
- Competitive intelligence and pricing strategies
- Utilization patterns and revenue optimization
- Event-based parking demand forecasting
- Geographic market expansion analysis
- Demographic targeting and segmentation
- Traffic pattern correlation with parking demand

### ETL Pipeline

See `research/etl_elt_pipeline.ipynb` for:
- Data extraction from government sources
- Data transformation and cleaning
