## Query 1: Multi-Retailer Price Comparison with Geographic Filtering and Temporal Trend Analysis

**Description:** Analyzes pricing across multiple retailers for products within geographic markets, incorporating temporal trends, price volatility metrics, and competitive positioning. Uses multiple CTEs to aggregate pricing data, calculate price differences, identify best deals, and track price movements over time with window functions.

**Use Case:** Competitive pricing analysis for retail intelligence platforms - identify best prices by location and track price trends over time

**Business Value:** Enables retailers and consumers to identify optimal pricing strategies and best deals by geographic market, supporting $1M+ ARR pricing intelligence platforms

**Purpose:** Provides comprehensive multi-retailer price comparison with geographic and temporal dimensions for strategic pricing decisions

**Complexity:** Deep nested CTEs (6+ levels), multiple joins across products/retailers/stores/pricing tables, window functions with frame clauses, percentile calculations, temporal aggregations, geographic filtering, correlated subqueries

**Expected Output:** Product pricing comparison report showing best prices by retailer and location, price trends, and competitive positioning metrics

## Query 2: Inventory Availability Prediction Using Historical Patterns and Geographic Distribution

**Description:** Predicts inventory availability by analyzing historical stock patterns, restocking frequencies, seasonal trends, and geographic distribution. Uses recursive CTEs for pattern detection, window functions for trend analysis, and complex aggregations to forecast stock levels.

**Use Case:** Inventory forecasting for retail operations - predict when products will be in stock and optimize restocking schedules

**Business Value:** Enables retailers to optimize inventory management, reduce stockouts, and improve customer satisfaction, supporting $1M+ ARR inventory intelligence platforms

**Purpose:** Provides predictive analytics for inventory availability based on historical patterns and geographic factors

**Complexity:** Recursive CTEs for pattern detection, multiple CTEs (7+ levels), window functions with complex frame clauses, temporal aggregations, geographic clustering, statistical forecasting calculations

**Expected Output:** Inventory availability predictions with confidence scores, restocking recommendations, and geographic distribution analysis

## Query 3: Market Share Analysis with Competitive Positioning and Temporal Trends

**Description:** Analyzes market share by retailer and product category, incorporating competitive positioning metrics, temporal trends, and geographic distribution. Uses multiple CTEs to calculate market share percentages, competitive rankings, share changes over time, and market concentration metrics with window functions.

**Use Case:** Competitive market analysis for retail intelligence - identify market leaders, track share changes, and analyze competitive dynamics

**Business Value:** Enables retailers to understand their market position, track competitive movements, and identify growth opportunities, supporting $1M+ ARR market intelligence platforms

**Purpose:** Provides comprehensive market share analysis with competitive positioning and temporal trend tracking

**Complexity:** Multiple CTEs (6+ levels), complex aggregations, window functions with frame clauses, percentile rankings, temporal comparisons, market concentration calculations

**Expected Output:** Market share report showing retailer rankings, share percentages, competitive positioning, and temporal trends by product category
