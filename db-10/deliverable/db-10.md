## Query 1: Multi-Retailer Price Comparison with Geographic Filtering and Temporal Trend Analysis {#query-1}

**Use Case:** **Competitive pricing analysis for retail intelligence platforms - identify best prices by location and track price trends over time**

**Description:** Analyzes pricing across multiple retailers for products within geographic markets, incorporating temporal trends, price volatility metrics, and competitive positioning. Uses multiple CTEs to aggregate pricing data, calculate price differences, identify best deals, and track price movements over time with window functions.

**Use Case:** Competitive pricing analysis for retail intelligence platforms - identify best prices by location and track price trends over time

**Business Value:** Enables retailers and consumers to identify optimal pricing strategies and best deals by geographic market, supporting $1M+ ARR pricing intelligence platforms

**Purpose:** Provides comprehensive multi-retailer price comparison with geographic and temporal dimensions for strategic pricing decisions

**Complexity:** Deep nested CTEs (6+ levels), multiple joins across products/retailers/stores/pricing tables, window functions with frame clauses, percentile calculations, temporal aggregations, geographic filtering, correlated subqueries

**Expected Output:** Product pricing comparison report showing best prices by retailer and location, price trends, and competitive positioning metrics

## Query 3: Market Share Analysis with Competitive Positioning and Temporal Trends {#query-3}

**Use Case:** **Competitive market analysis for retail intelligence - identify market leaders, track share changes, and analyze competitive dynamics**

**Description:** Analyzes market share by retailer and product category, incorporating competitive positioning metrics, temporal trends, and geographic distribution. Uses multiple CTEs to calculate market share percentages, competitive rankings, share changes over time, and market concentration metrics with window functions.

**Use Case:** Competitive market analysis for retail intelligence - identify market leaders, track share changes, and analyze competitive dynamics

**Business Value:** Enables retailers to understand their market position, track competitive movements, and identify growth opportunities, supporting $1M+ ARR market intelligence platforms

**Purpose:** Provides comprehensive market share analysis with competitive positioning and temporal trend tracking

**Complexity:** Multiple CTEs (6+ levels), complex aggregations, window functions with frame clauses, percentile rankings, temporal comparisons, market concentration calculations

**Expected Output:** Market share report showing retailer rankings, share percentages, competitive positioning, and temporal trends by product category

## Usage Instructions

1. **PostgreSQL Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Create database
   createdb db10

   # Load schema
   psql db10 < data/schema.sql

   # Load sample data (optional)
   psql db10 < data/data.sql
   ```

2. **Databricks Setup:**
   - Use Delta Lake format
   - Load schema.sql (adapting GEOGRAPHY types as needed)
   - Use Databricks SQL for query execution

3. **Snowflake Setup:**
   - Create database and schema
   - Load schema.sql (GEOGRAPHY types supported)
   - Use Snowflake SQL for query execution

Run the ETL pipeline to extract data from government APIs:

```bash
cd db-10/research
jupyter notebook etl_elt_pipeline.ipynb
```

Or use the bulk download script:

```bash
cd db-10/scripts
python3 smart_bulk_extract.py
```

All queries are located in `queries/queries.md` and can be executed directly on any supported database platform.

Run the validation suite:

```bash
cd db-10
python3 scripts/extract_queries_to_json.py  # Phase 0
python3 scripts/verify_fixes.py             # Phase 1
python3 scripts/comprehensive_validator.py  # Phase 2 & 4
python3 scripts/execution_tester.py         # Phase 3
python3 scripts/generate_final_report.py   # Phase 5
```

Or use the validate command:

```bash
/validate db-10
```
