# Insurance Rate Modeling Documentation - db-6

**Created:** 2026-02-03
**Purpose:** Insurance rate table determination using 7-14 day weather forecasts

## Overview

The insurance rate modeling extension enables insurance companies to calculate dynamic insurance rates based on forecasted weather risks. The system analyzes 7-14 day forecasts from December 3-17, 2025 to determine risk factors and generate rate tables.

## Key Features

1. **Risk Factor Calculation:** Analyzes multiple weather parameters (temperature, precipitation, wind, freeze, flood) to calculate comprehensive risk scores
2. **Rate Table Generation:** Generates insurance rate tables with risk-adjusted pricing based on forecast risk factors
3. **Multi-Day Forecast Comparison:** Compares rates across 7-14 day forecasts to select optimal forecast day
4. **Historical Validation:** Validates forecast-based rates against historical claims data
5. **Volatility Analysis:** Analyzes rate stability and volatility for consistent pricing
6. **Risk Ranking:** Ranks policy areas by risk level for portfolio management

## Usage Examples

### Calculate Risk Factors for Policy Area

```sql
-- Use Query 31 to calculate risk factors
SELECT * FROM insurance_risk_factors
WHERE policy_area_id = 'POLICY_AREA_001'
  AND forecast_period_start = DATE '2025-12-03'
  AND forecast_period_end = DATE '2025-12-17'
  AND forecast_day BETWEEN 7 AND 14;
```

### Generate Rate Tables

```sql
-- Use Query 32 to generate rate tables
SELECT * FROM insurance_rate_tables
WHERE policy_area_id = 'POLICY_AREA_001'
  AND forecast_period_start = DATE '2025-12-03'
  AND forecast_period_end = DATE '2025-12-17'
  AND forecast_day BETWEEN 7 AND 14;
```

### Compare Rates Across Forecast Days

```sql
-- Use Query 33 to compare rates
SELECT * FROM rate_table_comparison
WHERE policy_area_id = 'POLICY_AREA_001'
  AND forecast_period_start = DATE '2025-12-03'
  AND forecast_period_end = DATE '2025-12-17';
```

## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Overall Risk Score Calculation

The overall risk score is calculated as a weighted combination of individual risk components:

```
Overall Risk Score =
  (Precipitation Risk × 30%) +
  (Temperature Extreme Risk × 25%) +
  (Wind Damage Risk × 20%) +
  (Flood Risk × 15%) +
  (Extreme Event Probability × 10%)
```

### Risk Categories

- **Extreme:** Overall Risk Score ≥ 75
- **Very High:** Overall Risk Score ≥ 50
- **High:** Overall Risk Score ≥ 30
- **Moderate:** Overall Risk Score ≥ 15
- **Low:** Overall Risk Score < 15

### Rate Multipliers

- **Extreme Risk:** 2.5× base rate
- **Very High Risk:** 2.0× base rate
- **High Risk:** 1.5× base rate
- **Moderate Risk:** 1.25× base rate
- **Low Risk:** 1.0× base rate (no adjustment)

## Forecast Period

All insurance queries are designed for:
- **Forecast Period:** December 3-17, 2025
- **Forecast Days:** 7-14 days ahead
- **Forecast Dates:** December 3-17, 2025

## Compatibility

All insurance queries are designed to work across:
- PostgreSQL (with PostGIS)
- Databricks (Delta Lake)
- Snowflake

## Data Requirements

To use the insurance rate modeling queries, ensure:

1. **Weather Forecasts:** GRIB2 forecasts loaded for December 3-17, 2025 period
2. **Policy Areas:** Insurance policy areas mapped to geographic boundaries
3. **Historical Claims:** Claims history data for validation (optional but recommended)
4. **Risk Factors:** Risk factors calculated using Query 31 before generating rate tables

## Best Practices

1. **Calculate Risk Factors First:** Run Query 31 to calculate risk factors before generating rate tables
2. **Compare Across Forecast Days:** Use Query 33 to compare rates across 7-14 day forecasts
3. **Validate with Historical Data:** Use Query 34 to validate forecast accuracy against historical claims
4. **Monitor Volatility:** Use Query 35 to identify areas with high rate volatility
5. **Use Ensemble Analysis:** Use Query 38 for more robust rate determination
6. **Optimize Forecast Day:** Use Query 39 to select optimal forecast day for each policy area
